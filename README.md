# Repository Inspiration

This repository served as the foundation for [Repo2Txt.com](https://repo2txt.com/), a web-based tool designed to convert code repositories into formatted text files suitable for Large Language Model (LLM) prompts.

We expanded upon this concept to develop:

- [Local Directory to Plain Text Converter](https://repo2txt.com/local.html): Transforms local directories or compressed files into structured text formats. 

- [Web2Txt: AI-Friendly Web Scraper with Crawl4AI](https://repo2txt.com/crawl4ai.html): Extracts web content and converts it into Markdown, facilitating AI model training.
